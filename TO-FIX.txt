BUG:

General:

Skips Intro and goes straight to the game interface.

Stufe 1:
Dialogue is being skipped before the Game Over message.
If player position is the same as the hidden enemy position, the game still ends with being caught.

Stufe 3:
While mechanics work, dialogue is being skipped.
